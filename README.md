## Development Details

This was developed on Unity. Unfortunately, the source code for **Tiny Invasion** has been lost. However, you can still enjoy the game on Newgrounds and challenge yourself to achieve the highest score possible.

This was a solo project for a 48 hour game jam, all scripts, artwork and sounds were done by myself. A fun fact was this was all developed on Linux using the beta unity editor. (very buggy!)
